# Space Exploration

<img id="mdImg" src="assets/images/Space.jpg">

This project was designed with the intent to introduce new coders to teamwork and collaboration within the coding world. They chose to create a mobile-responsive website that allows users to explore data about the planets in our solar system

## Installation

​
## Usage 
​
In order to ensure this code can be viewed correctly, it must be viewed in a web browser, ideally Google Chrome as it has the best compatibility. You can do this using the following link: https://ryanhun7er.github.io/space/. The user can choose from a list of nine planets* that are in a dropdown menu and by clicking button 'search'. The carousel will change from a picture of the galaxy to the current planet selected. Information will be shown on each side of the carousel about the selected planets. A carousel below the main information is there should users want to look at more pictures associated with that planet. <br>

A button that says "Compare the Planets" will take the user to a new page, where he/she can compare the stats from the previous page side-by-side. The user again picks a planet from each drop down menu and upon clicking 'search', the data from both planets will be shown next to each other.

## Credits

The instructor and TA's of VU's coding bootcamp. Seriously, though.

Feel free to make this better. It's like Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, nothing is original. Take an axe for example, you're not going to reinvent the axe. However, you can always leave it sharper than when you found it.
